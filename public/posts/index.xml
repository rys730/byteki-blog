      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who used to spend hours gaming and only studied when necessary, I never imagined to find myself in the world of programming. Computers were just a way to pass the time. Until, one byte at a time, curiosity led me to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-encounter-with-code&#34;&gt;First Encounter with Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first real encounter with code was when I enrolled in a Computer Science program at university. Ironically, I had no real reason for choosing it—I didn’t know a single thing about programming, nor did I have any passion for it. I took some courses like algorithm, data structures, OOP, IoT, etc, but none of them spark any passion in me—at least, not yet. Although I got good grades on those courses, it didn&amp;rsquo;t give me any sense of accomplishment. It felt like I was just going through the motions without truly connecting with what I was learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
